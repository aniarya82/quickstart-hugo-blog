This is my notes on the book _When: The Scientific Secret of Perfect Timings_ by **Daniel Pink**
This book was recommend by Harsh Shah, founder of Fynd. During my summer internship there, he recommended this book during the annual townhall meeting.

## Chapter 1 - How to figure out you daily 'when'?

This question can be answered by three question method

1. Chronotype : Lark/Third/Owl

- Lark : A person who wakes up at 6-8am and sleeps at 9-11pm
- Owl : A person who wakes up at 2-4pm and sleeps at 5-6am
- Third : Exection of both above.

2. What do you need to do?

- Analytic task
- Insight task
- Making an impression
- Making a decision

3. EM LA a tabular method which I forgot

#### Set up a phone alarm every 90 min

Every time the alarm goes off, try to answer a couple of questions:

- What are you doing?
- On a scale of 1 - 10, how mentally alert you are?
- On a scale of 1 - 10, how physically alert you are?
  These are self assessment question and makes you take a break for a little while.
  Try to write answer to these questions and make a review of the entire day once before going to bed.

To prevent this mostly working in teams, have a well though checklist to ensure everyone is on same page at all times, so if someone slacks other can pull him up of ask them to take breaks. Eg. Green cards at University of Michigan Medical Center

1. Everyone stops, steps back, deep breaths
2. 30 seconds to report progress per member
3. 30 seconds to describe next steps per member
4. What is missing? Answers by every member
5. Assign member for missing task
6. Schedule another similar time-out
