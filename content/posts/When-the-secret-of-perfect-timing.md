This book was recommend by Harsh Shah, founder of Fynd. During my summer internship there, he recommended this book during the annual townhall meeting.

## Chapter 1 - How to figure out you daily 'when'?

This question can be answered by three question method

1. Chronotype : Lark/Third/Owl

#### Set up a phone alarm every 90 min

Every time the alarm goes off, try to answer a couple of questions:

- What are you doing?
- On a scale of 1 - 10, how mentally alert you are?
- On a scale of 1 - 10, how physically alert you are?
  These are self assessment question and makes you take a break for a little while.
  Try to write answer to these questions and make a review of the entire day once before going to bed.

Planing out such a routine will be most promising. Some tips for such are:

To prevent this mostly working in teams, have a well though checklist to ensure everyone is on same page at all times, so if someone slacks other can pull him up of ask them to take breaks. Eg. Green cards at University of Michigan Medical Center

1. Everyone stops, steps back, deep breaths
2. 30 seconds to report progress per member
3. 30 seconds to describe next steps per member
4. What is missing? Answers by every member
